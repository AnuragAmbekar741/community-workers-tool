# PRD — Community Worker M&E Tool

**Version:** 2.2 · Pilot scope
**Goal:** Workers log community sessions; supervisors view their workers' data; admin manages everyone.
**Principle:** Minimal — **3 tables** (`users`, `workers`, `sessions`), 3 roles, JWT-only auth, controlled lists as server constants.

---

## 1. Fixed entities

| Entity        | Count | How created                             |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| Admin         | 1     | Seeded at deploy (no organisation)      |
| Supervisor    | 2     | Seeded at deploy                        |
| Organisation  | 2     | Server constant (`org_a`, `org_b`)      |
| Village/Topic | Fixed | Server constants — locked before launch |
| Worker        | Many  | Self-register, then admin approves      |

---

## 2. Roles & RBAC

Three roles, enforced **server-side**. Every request carries a JWT with `{ userId, role }`.

| Capability                        | Worker | Supervisor | Admin |
| --------------------------------- | :----: | :--------: | :---: |
| Self-register                     |   ✅   |     —      |   —   |
| Log in (re-login on token expiry) | ✅\* |     ✅     |  ✅   |
| Add a session                     |  ✅\*  |     —      |   —   |
| View own sessions (list + detail) |   ✅   |     —      |   —   |
| Delete own session                |   ✅   |     —      |   —   |
| Update a session                  |   ❌   |     ❌     |  ✅   |
| View their workers (by id)        |   —    |     ✅     |  ✅   |
| View their workers' sessions      |   —    |     ✅     |  ✅   |
| Worker analytics                  |   —    |     ✅     |  ✅   |
| Download worker data as PDF       |   —    |     ✅     |  ✅   |
| Approve a worker                  |   —    |     —      |  ✅   |
| Assign worker to supervisor       |   —    |     —      |  ✅   |
| View ALL workers / ALL sessions   |   —    |     —      |  ✅   |
| Edit / delete any session         |   —    |     —      |  ✅   |

\* Only after `workers.status = approved`.

\* Workers may log in only after `workers.status = approved`. Session creation also requires approval.

**Middleware:** `requireAuth` (valid JWT) → `requireRole(...)` → ownership check (worker only own sessions; supervisor only workers where `supervisor_id = self`).

**Auth model:** login is **phone or system_id** plus **password** for everyone. JWT in an **HttpOnly cookie** (set by server on login only; cleared on logout) — no token in browser JSON, no PIN, no refresh token. Cookie expiry → log in again. See [auth.md](./auth.md).

- Admin + both supervisors are seeded (no signup path for them).
- **Registration is workers-only.** Workers select their **organisation** at registration (not assigned by admin). Registration creates a `pending` account; workers **cannot** log in until admin approves.
- Approval and supervisor assignment are admin actions (can be done together). Admin assigns a supervisor only — not organisation.
- **Org mapping:** workers and supervisors both belong to an org. A worker picks their org at registration; admin assigns them to a supervisor **in the same org**.

---

## 4. Functional requirements by role

### Worker

- Create an account (self-register → `pending`; select organisation during registration).
- Log in after admin approval; re-login when token expires (phone or system_id).
- Add session details (once approved).
- View list of own sessions / view one session.
- Delete an own session.
- **Cannot** update a session.

### Supervisor (2 accounts only)

- Log in.
- Get their assigned workers (ids).
- Get sessions of their workers.
- View worker analytics.
- Download their workers' data as PDF.

### Admin (1 account)

- Log in.
- Approve a worker.
- Assign / reassign a worker to a supervisor.
- Get all workers (ids).
- Get all workers' session details.
- Edit / delete any session.

## 5. API endpoints (current scope)

> `🔓` public · `👤` worker · `🧑‍🏫` supervisor · `🛡️` admin. Access per the RBAC matrix; roles do not auto-inherit.
> **Path params:** `/admin/workers/:id` → a worker `system_id` (`CW0001`); `/sessions/:id` → a `session_id` (`SESS000001`).

## 6. Key validation rules

- `total_reached` auto-calculated; reject if all six attendance fields are 0.
- `session_date` cannot be in the future.
- `duration_min` between 10 and 300.
- `session.village` must be in the worker's `villages`.
- Worker registration requires `consent_given = true`.

---

## 7. Out of scope

- Worker self-service stats (data already scoped by worker).
- Editing constants via UI (they live in code).
- Multi-district scale-up, offline sync, multi-language, 2FA, per-worker PIN.

---

## 8. Open items

- **Final village + topic lists** — lock before launch (changing a constant = redeploy).
- Hosting platform (custom vs KoboToolbox/DHIS2).
- Data retention + handover procedure.
